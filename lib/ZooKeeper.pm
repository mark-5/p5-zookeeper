=head1 NAME

ZooKeeper - Perl bindings for Apache ZooKeeper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $zk = ZooKeeper->new(hosts => 'localhost:2181');

    my $cv = AE::cv;
    my @children = $zk->get_children('/', watcher => sub { my $event = shift; $cv->send($event) });
    my $child_event = $cv->recv;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ZooKeeper is a perl interface to the Apache ZooKeeper C client library.

=head2 How is this different from Net::ZooKeeper?

=over 4

=item ZooKeeper is written for asynchronous programming.

To support asynchronous programs, watchers were implemented as code refs, which a ZooKeeper::Dispatcher asynchronously invokes with ZooKeeper event data. Conversely, Net::ZooKeeper used Net::ZooKeeper::Watch classes, which users must interact with using the wait method(which blocks).

=item ZooKeeper data is represented as normal perl data types.

ZooKeeper event and stat data are simply hashrefs and arrayrefs. Net::ZooKeeper instead provides specific perl classes for interacting with this data.

=item ZooKeeper leverages perl exception handling.

Instead of returning the C error codes, as Net::ZooKeeper does, ZooKeeper throws ZooKeeper::Error exceptions for unexpected return codes.

=back

=head2 Data Types

=over 4

=item acl

Acls are represented as an arrayrefs of hashrefs, where each hashref includes an id, scheme, and permissions. Permissions flags can be imported from the ZooKeeper::Constants package.

For instance, ZOO_READ_ACL_UNSAFE would be represented as:

    [{id => 'anyone', scheme => 'world', perms => ZOO_PERM_READ}]

=item event

A hashref of attributes for a watcher event. Includes the type of event(a ZooKeeper::Constants event), connection state(a ZooKeeper::Constants state) and the path of the node triggering the event.

    {
        path  => '/child',
        state => ZOO_CONNECTED_STATE,
        type  => ZOO_CHILD_EVENT,
    }

=item stat

A hashref of fields from a C Stat struct.

    {
        aversion       => 0,
        ctime          => 0,
        cversion       => 0,
        czxid          => 0,
        ephemeralOwner => 0,
        dataLength     => 0,
        mtime          => 0,
        mzxid          => 0,
        numChildren    => 2,
        pzxid          => 2334,
        version        => 0,
    }

=back

=head2 Dispatchers

ZooKeeper uses ZooKeeper::Dispatchers for communicating with callbacks registered by the C library. These callbacks are executed in separate POSIX threads, which write event data to a ZooKeeper::Channel and notify the dispatcher that an event is ready to be processed. How this notification occurs, and how perl callbacks are invoked, is what differentiates the types of dispatchers.

=over 4

=item AnyEvent

ZooKeeper writes to a Unix pipe with an attached AnyEvent I/O watcher. This means that perl callbacks for watchers will be executed by the AnyEvent event loop.

=item Interrupt

ZooKeeper uses Async::Interrupt callbacks. This means the perl interpreter will be safely interrupted(waits for the current op to finish) in order to execute the corresponding perl callback. See Async::Interrupt for more details on how callbacks are executed. Be aware that this does not interrupt system calls(such as select) and XS code. This means if your code is blocking on a select(such as during an AnyEvent recv), the interrupt callback will not execute until the call has finished.

=item IOAsync

ZooKeeper writes to a Unix pipe with an attached IO::Async::Handle.

The IO::Async dispatcher requires an IO::Async::Loop, and needs to be constructed manually

    my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
    my $disp = ZooKeeper::Dispatcher::IOAsync->new(loop => $loop);
    my $zk = ZooKeeper->new(
        hosts      => 'localhost:2181',
        dispatcher => $disp,
    );

=item POE

ZooKeeper writes to a Unix pipe with an attached POE::Session.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 hosts

A comma separated list of ZooKeeper server hostnames and ports.

    'localhost:2181'
    'zoo1.domain:2181,zoo2.domain:2181'

=cut

has hosts => (
    is       => 'ro',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 timeout

The session timout used for the ZooKeeper connection.

=cut

has timeout => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => 10 * 10**3,
);

=head2 watcher

A subroutine reference to be called by the default watcher for ZooKeeper session events. This attribute is read/write.

=cut

has watcher => (
    is => 'rw',
);

after watcher => sub {
    # this probably makes more sense as a trigger
    #  but triggers get run before BUILD
    #  which is a problem for watch instantiation
    return if @_ == 1;
    my ($self, $code) = @_;
    my ($path, $type) = ('', 'default');
    my %watcher_args  = (path => $path, type => $type);

    my @old = $self->get_watchers(%watcher_args);
    my $new = $self->create_watcher($path => $code, type => $type);
    $self->_set_watcher($new);
    $self->remove_watcher(%watcher_args, watcher => $_) for @old;
};


=head2 authentication

An arrayref used for authenticating with ZooKeeper. This will be passed as an array to add_auth.

    [$scheme, $credentials, %extra]

=cut

has authentication => (
    is => 'ro',
);

=head2 buffer_length

The default length of the buffer used for retrieving ZooKeeper data and paths. Defaults to 2048 bytes.

=cut

has buffer_length => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => 2048,
);

=head2 client_id

The client_id for a ZooKeeper session. Can be set during construction to resume a previous session.

=cut

=head2 dispatcher

The implementation of ZooKeeper::Dispatcher to be used. Defaults to AnyEvent.

Valid types include:

=over 4

=item AnyEvent

=item Interrupt

=item POE

=back

Instead of a string, a dispatcher object can be passed directly. This is necessary if the dispatcher has required attributes(as is the case for ZooKeeper::Dispatcher::IOAsync).

=cut

has dispatcher => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => sub { shift->isa('ZooKeeper::Dispatcher') },
    coerce  => \&_to_dispatcher,
    default => sub { $ENV{PERL_ZOOKEEPER_DISPATCHER} || 'AnyEvent' },
    handles => [qw(
        create_watcher
        get_watchers
        ignore_session_events
        remove_watcher
        wait
    )],
);
sub _to_dispatcher {
    my ($disp) = @_;
    return $disp unless $disp and not ref $disp;

    my $class = $disp =~ s/\^+// ? $disp : "ZooKeeper::Dispatcher::$disp";
    require_module($class);
    return $class->new;
}

=head2 ignore_session_events

If set to false, all watchers will be triggered for session events, such as disconnecting and reconnecting to the ZooKeeper server. This means that watchers can be triggered multiple times, until the watcher event is triggered.

The default value is true, which will only trigger watchers once, for the watcher event.

=cut

sub BUILD {
    my ($self, $args) = @_;

    $self->ignore_session_events($args->{ignore_session_events})
        if exists $args->{ignore_session_events};
    my $watcher = $self->watcher && do {
        $self->create_watcher('' => $self->watcher, type => 'default');
    };

    $self->_xs_init($self->hosts, $self->timeout, $watcher, $args->{client_id});
    $self->add_auth(@{$self->authentication||[]}) if $self->authentication;
}

    return $self->$orig($path, $watcher);
};

=head2 get

In list context, the data and stat hashref of the node is returned. Otherwise just the data is returned.

    my $data          = $zk->get($path, %extra)
    my ($data, $stat) = $zk->get($path, %extra)

        REQUIRED $path

        OPTIONAL %extra
            watcher
            buffer_length

=cut

around get => sub {
    my ($orig, $self, $path, %extra) = @_;
    my $watcher = $extra{watcher} ? $self->create_watcher($path, $extra{watcher}, type => 'get') : undef;
    return $self->$orig($path, $extra{buffer_length}//$self->buffer_length, $watcher);

        REQUIRED $path

=head2 set_acl

Set ACls for a node at the given path. Throws a ZooKeeper::Error on failure.

    $zk->set_acl($path => $acl, %extra)

        REQUIRED $path
        REQUIRED $acl

        OPTIONAL %extra

=head2 trace

Set the tracing level for the ZooKeeper client. Can also be set using the PERL_ZOOKEEPER_TRACE environmental variable, where PERL_ZOOKEEPER_TRACE=$level=$file traces to $file with debug level $level.

    $zk->trace($level, $file)

        REQUIRED $level
        OPTIONAL $file

=cut

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Forking

The underlying C library uses POSIX threads. This means that ZooKeeper is not fork safe. Only exec and POSIX::_exit can be guaranteed to work safely in the child process.

=head2 Signals

Many ZooKeeper recipes(such as in the examples directory), rely on clients properly shutting down to delete ephemeral nodes. Otherwise the ZooKeeper server will wait for the entire duration of the timeout specified by the session, before cleaning up. If you are expecting your program to handle signals(such as SIGINT), make sure the program is properly catching them and exiting. See the examples for more information.
